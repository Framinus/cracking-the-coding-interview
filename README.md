# First round solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview

The solutions I am posting here are not researched, or necessarily the most optimal. (Of course I am trying!) They are my first attempt at these problems. I will go back and add my refactoring functions as I continue to learn new ways to solve these algorithms.

I am not including the questions in these files out of respect for the author, Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Please go buy the book!

I am solving these algorithms primarily in my most comfortable coding language, JavaScript, but may try to implement solutions in other languages just for fun!
